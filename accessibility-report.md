**Principle 1: Equitable Use**

The program is designed for users who can see and understand visual information, using clear charts and graphs.
It does not currently support users with visual impairments, especially in fast-paced trading environments.
Therefore, it only partially meets this principle.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**

Users can change the interface to match their preferences, making it easier to use.
The program allows different ways to input data, like using a keyboard or a mouse, to fit various user needs.

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**

The program shows clear signs to indicate what actions are possible, helping users know what to do next.
It also alerts users when an action isn't allowed, making it easier for those new to financial tools to navigate.

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**

Made for day traders and finance experts who need to quickly understand data.
It expects users to stay focused, which might not work well for those who need extra help to see or hear information.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**

The program includes confirmation steps to avoid mistakes, ensuring actions are intentional.
It stops users from doing things that don't make sense, like trying to remove a stock when there are none, which helps reduce errors.

**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**

Users can add stocks using either dropdown menus or keyboard shortcuts, making it easier on their hands.
There's a "quick remove all" option that lets users clear their portfolios easily without much effort.

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**

The interface has large buttons and clear displays, making it easy to use.
It responds quickly to user actions, so everything happens smoothly and is easy to see.

**Target Audience**

Our program is aimed at active day traders. It provides strong tools for testing trading strategies and managing investment portfolios. It also suits those interested in financial markets and data analysis, helping both experienced traders and beginners improve their market skills.

**Potential Exclusion of Certain Demographics**

Our program mainly serves two groups: active day traders and people interested in finance or statistics. Active day traders are expected to have few disabilities, so the program is built for quick decision-making. This might make it harder for users with visual or motor challenges to use. On the other hand, people interested in finance and statistic but not actively trading could benefit from added features like voice commands or adjustable speeds. By balancing features between two groups, we can make the program more accessible to a wider range of users.
